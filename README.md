# Term-Paper
This repo contains the files for my final project as part of the course Numerical Methods.
The file NM.pdf contains the presentation of the project as well as the explanation of the paper.jl code. I put in the repo also the file valuefunction.jl, which contains the failed attempt to endogenize some baseline parameters(the value functions don't converge!).
Pictures of the graphs are included in the folder Plots.
